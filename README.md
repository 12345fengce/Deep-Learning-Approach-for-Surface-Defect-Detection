# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Surface-Defect-Detection
  A Tensorflow implementation of "(cvpr2019)[Segmentation-Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface-Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08536v1.pdf)"
# The test nevironment
      python 3.6
      cuda 9.0
      cudnn 7.1.4
      Tensorflow 1.12
# You should know
   I used the Dataset used in the papar, you can download [KolektorSDD](https://www.vicos.si/Downloads/KolektorSDD
) here 
 
    
   If you train you own datset ,you should change the dataset interfence for you dataset.
