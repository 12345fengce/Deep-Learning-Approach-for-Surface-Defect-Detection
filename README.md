# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Surface-Defect-Detection
  A Tensorflow implementation of "(cvpr2019)Segmentation-Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface-Defect Detection"
# The test nevironment
      python 3.6
      cuda 9.0
      cudnn 7.1.4
      Tensorflow 1.12
# Dataset
   I used the Dataset used in the papar, you can download [KolektorSDD](https://www.baidu.com) here 
 
    
   If you train you own datset ,you should change the dataset interfence for you dataset.
