# You should know

  I used the Dataset used in the papar, you can download [KolektorSDD](https://www.vicos.si/Downloads/KolektorSDD) here.
  If you train you own datset ,you should change the dataset interfence for you dataset.

  You can refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08536v1.pdf) for details of the experiment.
  Although, I did not strictly follow the params of the papar , I still got a good result.
